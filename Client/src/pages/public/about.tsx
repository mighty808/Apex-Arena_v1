              We exist to solve real problems in the African gaming ecosystem, unreliable prize payments, unverified organizers, and the absence of a trusted neutral platform. Apex Arenas brings mandatory escrow, automated payouts, and verified tournament hosting to every competition, from local cups to national championships.

              Apex Arenas does not run tournaments or fund prize pools. Independent organizers use our platform to create and manage events, while players compete with confidence knowing every prize is locked in escrow before play begins.
